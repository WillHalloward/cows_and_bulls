# Cows and Bulls game created in c++
This is a collage project for the course "Introduction to c++" 
Goal was to create a Cows and bulls game where in the player can select between 3 different modes. 
Player is the code cracker.
CPU is the code cracker.
CPU vs CPU.
The algorithm for cracking the code is almost optimal. True optimal never takes more then 7 turns to solve a 4 digit number. Current algorithm sometimes take 8. Avg solve time is 5.4595 turns.
